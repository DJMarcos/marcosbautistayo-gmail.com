	I never knew I would one day be back in school especially studying coding,
	something I never knew I would ever study. I have always been a hands on worker type,
	and being on a computer 8 hours a day really threw me off.

			<h1>WHY DID I GO BACK TO SCHOOL?</h1>
			<p>I have love challanges ever since I could remember and since coding for me is new and I know nothing about it,
			I wanted to see how much of a challange this is, and see what Im capable of.</p>
